                <br>
                <p class="descgenre">Anime is a hand-drawn and computer-generated animation originating
                        from Japan. Outside Japan and in English, anime refers specifically
                        to animation produced in Japan. However, in Japan and in Japanese, anime 
                        describes all animated works, regardless of style or origin.

                        what does it mean to be 'correct' or 'true'? Merely vague concepts... Their 'reality' may all be a mirage.
                        Can we consider them to simply be living in their own world, shaped by their beliefs?"

                    <p class="c8p3">"Life is not about heroes and monsters, my boy. We're all born with the power to become either one. The choices we make, the paths we walk—they define us. Some choose the path of least resistance, the comfort of the familiar, while others embark on a journey into the unknown, facing the challenges that come their way.
                         But in the end, we're all driven by something—be it revenge, ambition, or the pursuit of a dream. 
                        It's what gives life its shape and meaning.
                        And in this chaotic world, where kings rise and fall, alliances shatter, and the only constant is change, one must be adaptable.
                        To survive, one must be cunning, learn to play the game, and know when to break the rules. 
                        Remember, my boy, power is not just in the swing of a sword; 
                        it's in the mind, the heart, and the ability to see beyond the surface.
                        Life is a series of battles, and the true warrior is the one who faces them head-on, unburdened by illusions and unafraid to make the choices that will shape his destiny."

                        It's not just about being the strongest physically. It's about having a heart that refuses to back down, a spirit that burns with unwavering resolve. 
                        In the face of adversity, a true warrior doesn't falter. 
                        They stand tall, face the challenge head-on, and protect those who can't protect themselves. 
                        That's the essence of a Hashira, and that's the flame that will never be extinguished."
